# AI Inventory Loss & Wastage Predictor for Small Retailers

## Problem Statement
Small retail shop owners and MSMEs in India frequently face inventory losses due to overstocking, slow-moving items, expired goods, improper storage practices, and incorrect demand estimation—especially for grains, pulses, and perishable goods during seasonal and climatic changes. Although sales data exists through billing systems or manual records, it is rarely analyzed to prevent losses proactively.

## Proposed Solution
This project proposes an AI-powered inventory risk prediction system that analyzes historical sales data to identify products at high risk of wastage or spoilage. In addition to risk identification, the system provides AI-guided storage and handling recommendations to help retailers take preventive actions and reduce losses.

## Target Users
- Kirana store owners  
- Small retail businesses  
- Local MSMEs  

## Key Features
- Upload or use existing sales data (CSV format)
- Identify slow-moving and dead-stock items
- Predict inventory items at risk of expiry or spoilage
- AI-guided storage and handling recommendations for high-risk inventory items (e.g., grains, pulses, packaged goods)
- Festival and season-aware demand insights
- Simple text-based explanations instead of complex dashboards

## How AI is Used
A Large Language Model (LLM) analyzes structured sales data along with contextual factors such as product type, seasonality, and sales velocity. Based on identified risk patterns, the AI generates human-readable insights explaining:
- Why certain items are at risk
- What preventive storage or handling actions can reduce losses

## Expected Impact
- Reduced inventory wastage and spoilage
- Improved storage practices for grains and packaged goods
- Better purchasing and stocking decisions
- Increased profitability for small retailers
- Adoption of practical, data-driven decision-making among MSMEs

## Project Status
- Idea finalized
- Architecture and initial POC under development
